# Tree Structure

//     9
//   4    20
// 1   6  15   170

1. right node should be greater than left node
2. root node should be between left and right node


## Binary Search Tree Types

1. Perfect Binary Tree, no node has one child
2. Full Binary Tree, node eithe none or full of children. no one node has one child

## Binary Search Tree

lookup O(Long N)
insert O(Long N)
delete O(Long N)

Level 0: 2^0 = 1
Level 1: 2^1 = 2
Level 2: 2^3 = 4
Level 3: 2^4 = 8

number of nodes 2^h - 1 = 

log node = log ( 2^h -1 ) = h  represents how many layers of the tree

## BST Good Side
Better then O(n)
Ordered
Flexisble size

## BST Bad Side
No O(1) operation, array has push and lookup operations O(1)


## Balanced Search Tree

balance tree's methods are
AVL Trees - 
Red Black Trees - https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html
