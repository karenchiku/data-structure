#### Which one works well Arrays vs Linked List to create a stack ?

(O) Array
(O) Linked List

both array and linked list work fine

### Queues

FIFO = First In  First Out

Lookup O(n)
enqueue O(1)
dequeue O(1)
peek O(1)

**reman store** || Matt <-- Joy <-- Smair <-- Pavel 

#### Which one works well Arrays vs Linked List to create a queue ?

(X) Arrays is bad idea for queue creation. because FIFO delete first one in the queue is O(n)
(O) Linked List is better for queue creation. because delete first one only need to repoint the head to the next one.

## Stack vs Queues

|              | stake  | queue |

|  Logic       | LIFO   | FIFO  |
| Linkded List |    v   | v     |
| Array        | v      | x     |
