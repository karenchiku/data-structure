### Recursion

ls -R // list items recursively from current folder. the function recures to itself.

// 1. Identify the base case
// 2. Identify the recursive case
// 3. Get closer and closer abd return when needed. Usually you have 2 returns

Anything  you do with a recusion can be done iteratively(loop)

factorial - O(n)
Fibonacci - iteratively O(n) recursively O(2^n)

#### Recursion Good

Dry, Readability

#### Recursion Bad

Large Stack

#### When to Use Recursion

Every Time you are using a tree or converting Something into a tree, consider recursion
1. Divided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the samee proble,
2. Each instance of the subpronblems is identical in nature
3. The solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand


### sorting

sorting is not big a deal if the data size is small.
when you are dealing with a big data size, custom a sorting function will be needed.

sorting algorithm: 
    - bubble Sort, the most simple algorithm but the worst, O(n^2)
    - Insertion Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort



### Dynamic Programming


### BFS + DFS
